PhosphoRecoderSE is an application that performs a directed search for phosphopeptides with specific patterns of phosphorylation sites. It is distributed with a modified version of MS-GF+ (e.g., Phospho-MSGF+) that interprets amino acids B/U/Z as phosphorylated S/T/Y so that specific phosphopeptides can be targeted directly.
